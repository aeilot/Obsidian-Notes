## What's learning

generalize → predict (predicting the future based on the past)

examples: objects that our algorithm will make predictions about

The goal of inductive machine learning: take some training data and use it to induce a function $f$.

This function $f$ will be evaluated on the test data.

The machine learning algorithm has succeeded if its performance on the test data is high.

## Learning Problems
1. Regression: trying to predict a real value
2. Binary Classification: trying to predict a simple yes/no response
3. Multi-class Classification: trying to put an example into one of a number of classes
4. Ranking: trying to put a set of objects in order of relevance
## Decision Tree

divide & conquer
