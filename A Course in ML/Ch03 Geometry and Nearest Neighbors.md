# Feature Vectors

feature values $\to$ feature vectors

 Individual features are combined into a multi-dimensional space to form feature vectors.

* binary features 0/1
* categorical features (ordered set)
* real-valued features
# K-Nearest Neighbors

inductive bias: the label for an example should be similar to the label of nearby points, all features are equally important

Find K nearest neighbors and let them vote

# K-Means Clustering

 K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points into K clusters based on similarity.
